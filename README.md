# rc_tweaks WordPress Plugin

## Description
The `rc_tweaks` plugin provides three main features for WordPress sites using the custom post type `envira`:

1. **Envira RSS Feed:** Generates an XML/RSS feed for the last 10 published `envira` posts, sorted by publication date (descending).
2. **Envira Gallery Table Page:** Automatically creates a page that displays a table of 3 random published `envira` galleries (excluding those in the "Dustrat" category), each showing up to 3 images from the gallery, sorted by oldest publication date first, rendered within your theme's header and footer.
3. **Envira Gallery Categories Widget:** Adds a widget that displays a bulleted list of Envira categories (with gallery counts) in the sidebar, only on single Envira gallery pages.
4. **Envira Album Categories Widget:** Adds a widget that displays a bulleted list of all Envira categories (with gallery counts) in the sidebar, only on Envira album post type pages and album taxonomy pages (e.g. `/album/members-gallery`).

## Features

```

### Envira Gallery Table Page
- On activation, a page titled **Envira Gallery Table** is created at `/envira-gallery-table/`.
- This page displays a table of the 3 most recent published Envira galleries, each with up to 3 images.
- You can also use the `[rc_envira_gallery_table]` shortcode in any page or post to display the gallery table.

### Envira Tags Widget
- Go to **Appearance â†’ Widgets** in your WordPress admin.
- Add the **Envira Gallery Tags** widget to your sidebar or any widget area.
- The widget will only appear on single Envira gallery pages and will display a list of tags for the current gallery.
