# rc_tweaks WordPress Plugin

## Description
The `rc_tweaks` plugin provides three main features for WordPress sites using the custom post type `envira`:

1. **Envira RSS Feed:** Generates an XML/RSS feed for the last 10 published `envira` posts, sorted by publication date (descending).
2. **Envira Gallery Table Page:** Automatically creates a page that displays a table of the 3 most recent published `envira` galleries, each showing up to 3 images from the gallery, rendered within your theme's header and footer.
3. **Envira Tags Widget:** Adds a widget that displays a list of tags in the right navigation bar, but only on single Envira gallery pages.

## Features
- Fetches the latest 10 published posts of type `envira` and outputs them as an RSS feed.
- Adds a new page (`/envira-gallery-table/`) with a table of the 3 latest Envira galleries and images.
- Includes a shortcode `[rc_envira_gallery_table]` to display the gallery table anywhere.
- Provides a widget to display tags for Envira galleries in the sidebar, visible only on single Envira gallery pages.
- Easy integration with WordPress.

2. Upload the `rc_tweaks` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
